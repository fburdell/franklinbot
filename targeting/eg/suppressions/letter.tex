\section*{Suppressions}

Suppressions are designed to be used as an \textit{removal} 'step add' in Votebuilder after setting the intended target such that voters who match some criteria, may be removed.

Suppressions additionally assume that campaigns are \textit{not} performing face-to-face canvassing operations in the field. Instead, the suppressions target assume that 'geogrpahic' based field operations do not include identification collection, or other in-person conversations. 

\subsection*{Geogrpahic}

Due to the aforementioned assumptions, the Geographic Suppression includes only voters marked with contacts, refusals, hostilities or other that were marked in geographic specific operations-- whether that be distributed, relational, or some other canvassing operation.

\subsection*{Non-Geogrpahic}

By inverse, the Non-Geogrpahic Suppresion includes only voters marked with contacts, refulsals, hostilities, or other that were marked in non-geographic specific operations-- whether that be texting, phone call, auto-dialer, relational or some other virtual field operation.
